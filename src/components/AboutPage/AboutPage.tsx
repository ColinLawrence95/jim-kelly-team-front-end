                    With over 35 years of real estate experience — and a background as a
                    professional engineer — Jim Kelly brings unmatched knowledge, precision, and
                    strategy to every transaction. As the founder and leader of The Jim Kelly Team,
                    Jim built the group with one mission in mind: to share his proven success and
                    empower others to thrive under his guidance. Known as a sharp negotiator and a
                    true expert in the market, Jim is deeply committed to helping his clients secure
                    the best possible outcome for their goals. His calm, confident approach — even
                    in the most high-stakes deals — comes from decades of experience navigating
                    complex transactions with clarity and care. Detail-oriented and laser-focused,
                    Jim doesn't settle for less than excellence. Originally from the small town of
                    Dundee, Scotland, Jim immigrated to Canada to build a great life for his wife
                    and children — a decision rooted in the same values he brings to his work every
                    day: dedication, resilience, and a relentless work ethic. His personal motto
                    says it all: "The words I can't are not in my vocabulary.”
